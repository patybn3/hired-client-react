# Hired

A front-end framework template for starting projects with a recent version of
either the [Rails API Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
or the [Express API Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/express-api-template).

## Installation

1. [Download](../../archive/master.zip) this template.
1. Unzip and rename the template directory (`unzip ~/Downloads/react-auth-template-master.zip`).
1. Move into the new project and `git init`.
1. Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1. Replace `react-auth-template` in `package.json` with your
   projects name.
1. Replace the `"homepage"` field in `package.json` with your (public) Github
   account name and repository name.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. `git add` and `git commit` your changes.
1. Run the development server with `npm start`.

## Deployment

Before deploying, you first need to make sure the `homepage` key in your
`package.json` is pointing to the correct value. It should be the url of your
deployed application.

To deploy you should first make sure you are on the `master` branch with a
clean working directory, then you can run `npm run deploy` and wait to see if
it runs successfully.

## Other dependencies

This project used Style Component CSS for styling. To install style Component:
1. `npm install styled-components` - You might see the following message:
  - `npm WARN bootstrap@4.3.1 requires a peer of jquery@1.9.1 - 3 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

  + styled-components@5.0.1
  added 19 packages from 14 contributors in 7.38s`
2. In this case, install the following dependencied:
  - `npm install --save bootstrap`
  - `npm install jquery@1.9.1`
  - `npm install popper.js --save`
3. Run Style Component again: `npm install styled-components`

4. The following package was installed to facilitate the styling of this page's footer: `npm install react-sticky-footer --save`


## About

This template is derived from GA Boston's [react-template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/react-template).
Most of the development dependencies, such as linters, SCSS compiler, Webpack
config, NPM scripts, etc in this repo come from there.

It includes all the components and routes needed to sign up, sign in, change
passwords, and sign out of an API built with either template linked above, with
no need for modification.

**NOTE**: You should customize the included components to suit you app! They're
provided as a guide and a bare minimum of functionality and style. Consider
changing the provided SCSS styles, modifying the auth code, improving the flash
messages, etc.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `npm run nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code and complains.
- `npm run make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard
  Style.
- `npm run start`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads.
- `npm run build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
- `npm run deploy`: builds and deploys master branch
